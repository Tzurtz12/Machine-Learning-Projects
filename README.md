# Machine Learning Lecture Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning Lecture Projects repository! This repository contains the projects I completed as part of a machine learning lecture. The projects include:

1. **Transformer for Sequence Prediction**: Implementing and completing code to build a transformer that predicts a sequence of following numbers.
2. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**: Developing a VQE for solving quantum problems.
